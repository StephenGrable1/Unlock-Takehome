###How to Run
1. Clone or download the project to you computer
2. Navigate to the folder holding the files and run <code>npm install</code>
3. Then run <code>npm start</code> and the app should open up on localhost:3000


###Spec
As a final exercise, we'd like to ask you to work on a take home exercise. 
This is to assess your technical skills with some of the key front end 
technologies that we use. 
Here's a description of what we're looking for: 
*On the Ethereum blockchain, the main currency is Ether, but it comes with 
many sub-units. We would like you to build currency converter which would 
convert any amount of Ether (or its sub-units) into fiat currencies (please 
include at least 3). The user should be able convert from Ether to fiat or 
the other way around. In the latter case, the tool will display the most 
‘readable’ unit. For example, instead of showing 0.000123 Ether, the tool 
should show 123 Szabo. Please make sure that value fields are also 
formatted (spaces, coma, dots, and units).* 
*For this, we require that you use React but you’re welcome to use other 
tools that you deem appropriate. Your code should be documented and tested. 
We require that you use source code versioning.* 
*You can use any source for your conversions or even come up with your own 
conversion rates.* 
*We will not expect you to spend more than 4 hours on this project.* 
*Please remember: the goal of this exercise is to assess your knowledge of 
the front end stack and your ability to deliver product for users. It is 
not to assess your knowledge of Ethereum.*
